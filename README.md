## Lab 1 (L1)
[Sochin-Iitsu](https://github.com/Sochin-Iitsu)  
This assignment forks the Programs repository from [NMSU-SDev](https://github.com/NMSU-SDev/Programs), where new subdirectories, .txt files, .xml files, and even a small .java program are added, tracked, and committed to the repository.

## Program 1 and Program 2
These assignments rely on the SimpleWebServer program. Each gets graded using tags in a cloned repository. 

## Program 3
This assignment relies on the Coverage programs. 

## Program 4
This assignment relies on the Circles programs.
